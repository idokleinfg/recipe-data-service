# recipe-data-service
Recipe Data Service is a microservice implemented as part of my sample exercise. It sources 
the data for recipe information and supports an API for data manipulation. 

The project was created using the http://start.spring.io/ starter. I selected to build using 
Gradle and selected dependencies that included Security, AOP DevTools, Web and JPA.
